# Cyber FastTrack Spring 2021
## BE01 write up

Brief: Download be01.zip and get flag. Contents: chicken.pdf
![](<ctfs/images/BE01 brief.PNG>)

After extracting chicken.pdf, I first used the file command to confirm the file type is PDF.
```zsh
file chicken.pdf
```

I ran the strings command and noticed that 'egg.zip' appeared multiple times...interesting.

Based on what I found from the strings output, let's see if there's any hidden files we can extract from this PDF by using binwalk.

```zsh
binwalk -e chicken.pdf
```

The output:

Immediately we see that there's another zip file within this pdf, called egg.zip.
We extract egg.zip to find...a chicken.zip...and finally an egg.pdf with the flag!

Got a chuckle off this challenge, appreciate the creators for this.
