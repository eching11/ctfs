Extract fe01.ost from fe01.zip and see what file type it is.

I wonder if I can use binwalk to extract any interesting files...

Also tried foremost to see anything...

Ok, not bad looks like we're trying to find a file named flag.jpg within the ost file.

Not sure how to proceed so will do a quick duckduckgo search which led me to this [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/611112/how-to-open-convert-ost-file-microsoft-outlook-email-folder-on-linux)

While you're waiting to install pffexport...
```
sudo apt install pff-tools
```

*Optionally get lost in the sauce with [Email and appointment falsification analysis by Joachim Metz](https://github.com/libyal/documentation/blob/main/PFF%20forensics%20-%20e-mail%20and%20appoinment%20falsification%20analysis.pdf), an article about email authenticity in forensics.*

Notice that pffexport created a new directory called fe01.ost.export.

Looks like a lot of files in here so let's try a find piped into grep.

While trying to extract the 1_flag.zip file, it prompts us for a password...hmm

Ok...shifting through these messages via command line is taking a while so there must be a better way. *Enter free pst viewer* Kinda wish I looked into this from the start...oh well, next time next time.

After several minutes of poking around in a graphical interface...found what looks like a password!
