# Cyber FastTrack Spring 2021
## FE04 write up

Brief: Download the file and filter down to the username according to the following criteria:
* x is 3rd character, immediately followed by a number from 2 to 6
* has a Z character
* last character is S

Based on the brief, looks like grep is the command to use. There are many ways to whittle down this list of presumably 50K usernames.
I didn't show it in the following image, but I broke the challenge apart by its components. I started at the top of the list of criteria and as I checked that my grep was working, I added onto the command. I could have also used multiple piped greps like shown in the last command before getting the username.
